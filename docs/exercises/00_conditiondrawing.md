## Description

Using Sol LeWitt as a starting point, design your own set of writing instruction to produce a drawing.

### Be inventive!

Some possibilities:

- Use dice to introduce randomness
- Create certain conditions based on colors or types of lines
- Explore folding, and using both sides of the paper

### Steps:
1. Collect some materials
1. Write your instructions
2. Make a drawing with your conditions
3. Refine your *code*
4. Repeat as many times as you need

### Share:

**After some time, we'll exchange our instructions and see what drawings emerge.**
