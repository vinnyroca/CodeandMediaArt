# In-Class Exercise: Random Dots

## Description

Use what we have learned about `random()` and variables to make a sketch similar to the one below. Your sketch should slowly add dots with different levels of opacity in random positions across the canvas.

Optional: make the color of of the dots vary slightly.

Steps to begin:

1. Consider how you can use the draw loop to draw a dot in a different position each time it is called.
2. Consider what variables you'll need.
3. Consider how you can assign random values to variables while your program is running.
