## Part 1: Turrell

Reflect on your experience of the relationship between the LED color lights and the color of the sky. This work is a form of new media art! The lights that are part of the work had to be programmed to match with the time of day and to change colors as the sky changes.

**Exercise:** Write a poetic set of instructions for James Turrell's *Dividing the Light*. How would you describe the colors? What is the progression of the piece? Be as specific as possible. Next class we'll be talking about how we can change values within our code while our program is running. Consider what values are changing with the lights to give different results.

## Part 2: Pusey

1. Read the article in our class library about the work of Mavis Pusey.

2. Using Pusey's painting *Personante* as inspiration, create your own abstract composition in p5.js.

Experiment with:

- Alpha
- `ellipse()`[(Reference)](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/ellipse/)
- `quad()` [(Reference)](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/quad/)
- `triangle()`[(Reference)](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/triangle/).
- `blendMode()`[(Reference)](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/blendMode/)
