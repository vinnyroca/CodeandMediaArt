By appointment; Tuesday & Thursday 1:30-2:30 Schedule office hours Course Description This interdisciplinary introductory course explores technical, artistic, and cultural aspects of programming. Using accessible and inclusive programming environments, students will learn the fundamentals of programming through making visual, interactive, and sound-based projects. Through readings and weekly discussions, students will engage with the political, economic, and cultural impact of code with a particular interest in code as an artistic medium and the power relations in programming. Learning Outcomes The objective of this course is to introduce the fundamental skills of programming for the arts and contextualize this technical knowledge within the cultural, social, economic, and political impact of programming. Through reading responses, projects, discussions, and technical tutorials, students will achieve the following learning outcomes: Technical proficiency in the fundamentals of object-oriented and procedural programming. Ability to analyze the role of programming in media art. Ability to analyze programming as a cultural, historical, and technical object. Gain a critical understanding of the history and cultural impact of programming. Ability to create visual, interactive, and sound-based media art projects using programming. Grading, Assignments, Course Policy Course Breakdown % 15 Time 15 Interactive 15 Performance 15 Game 10 Participation 10 Reading Responses 40 Exercises Evaluation Criteria Projects Completed projects will be graded using the following criteria: Technique Is the assignment well-crafted? Is the conceptual idea behind the assignment supported by the technical and artistic decisions made by the student? Concept Does the student comprehend the scope of the assignment? Is the student able to communicate their ideas clearly? Does the student demonstrate comprehension of the concepts covered in class? Is the student able to articulate the concepts behind their work? Generosity Does the student exhibit insight, criticality, and risk-taking in their work? How much sensitivity and critical insight does the student display towards personal assignments and in critiquing their peers\u2019 work? Exercises Exercises are mainly for student practice and experimentation. Exercises will be graded on their level of completion following the exercise prompt. Participation As this course includes in-person discussions, critiques, tutorials and exercises active participation and attendance make up 10 percent of students\u2019 final grade. All students are required to participate actively during the discussion periods, which will be facilitated using each student\u2019s reading responses. Students more than ten minutes late for class will be marked as late. Three late marks will result in an unexcused absence. More than two unexcused absences may, at the instructor\u2019s discretion, affect the final participation grade. All critique classes are mandatory. If you anticipate missing a critique class or expect to have more than two absences during the course, inform the instructor as soon as possible. Reading Responses Reading responses are due by 5 p.m. the day before discussions. Reading responses should be posted in proper Discord channel. Reading responses will be graded on the level of engagement the student has with the text. Is the student connecting the text to other readings or experiences? Is the student engaging with the text through questions, disagreements, or new lines of thought? As reading responses are essential to the discussion section of the course, late reading responses will not be accepted. Late Work and Extensions For all exercises, late work will not be accepted. Completing exercises on time is essential to the progression of the course. Not completing exercises will result in a student falling behind. In the situation that extra time is needed to complete exercises, students must reach out to the instructor as soon as possible. Late projects not ready by their assigned crit day will automatically lose one letter grade. Each day the project is late, it will lose one more letter grade. After three days, the project will not be accepted. Discord and Email For this class, we will be sharing our exercises, reading responses and project pieces through Discord. Students will be invited to join the class Discord server on the first day of class. I will respond to Discord messages and email within 24 hrs of receipt. I will respond to messages sent over the weekend on the following Monday. Box Submissions Submissions for the class will be made through Box links Links to Box submissions will be on the class website. Readings All readings are provided by the Instructor using this [link]. Password for readings will be provided in the class Discord. Course Materials Students are expected to work on exercises and assignments outside of class. To complete assignments students will need to have Processing installed on their computers. Scripps College Land Acknowledgement We would like to respectfully acknowledge that Scripps College sits within the historic homeland of the Tongva people. We acknowledge the painful history of genocide and colonization in our area. We acknowledge the strength and resilience of the Tongva people of the past, present, and future as the original caretakers of the land, water, and air, and we recognize our responsibility to be respectful stewards of the Scripps College campus. Today, this area and this campus are home to many Indigenous people from across the globe and we are proud that they are part of our community and institution. Statement on Inclusion We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. This means that we will use preferred pronouns, respect self-identifications, and be mindful of special needs. Disagreement is encouraged and supported, however, our differences affect our conceptualization and experience of reality, and it is extremely important to remember that certain gender, race, sex, and class identities are more privileged while others are undermined and marginalized. Consequently, this makes some people feel more protected or vulnerable during debates and discussions. A collaborative effort between the students and Instructor is needed to create a supportive learning environment. While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as a valuable opportunity for us to grow and learn from one another. Alternatively, if you feel that something said in discussion or included in a piece of work is harmful, you are encouraged to speak with the Instructor.

About Processing Procesing is an open source project by Casey Raes and Ben Fry . It is a development environment in which artists and designers can both produce software art and learn how to code. Processing conceptually builds on the idea that artists make use of forms of \"programming\" and instructions. Agnes Martin. Untitled. 1999. Soll LeWitt. Wall Drawing #260. 1975. Processing is a tool for making software. Processing's approach to software: Software is a unique medium with unique qualities Every programming language is a distinct material Sketching is necessary for the development of ideas Programming is not just for engineers \"Processing...repositions programming in a way that is accessible to people who are interested in programming but who may be intimidated by or uninterested in the type taught in computer science departments. The computer originated as a tool for fast calculations and has evolved into a medium for expression.\" -Casey Raes, Ben Fry - Processing: a programming handbook for visual designersand artists Processing started in 2001 and has grown into the Processing Foundation which includes a web interpretation of Processing called P5.js , created by Lauren Lee McCarthy .

Surrogate. 2021 What is Processing? We spent our first day drawing with are human understandable instructions. To write instructions for our computer to make artworks with our computer, we need to write our instructions in a language the computer understanding. To do that we are going to be writing instructions for our code in the Processing programming language. Processing is built on Java. Interface of Processing Interface of Processing The interface of Processing is fairly simple: The large area in the center functions like a text editor where we can enter the instructions (also know as code ) for our artworks. The play button at the top allows us to run our code. The stop button stops our code. The top menus allow us to access various options related to the Processing editor. Customize your Processing Editor Navigate to Tools -> Theme Selector -> the select a theme. Selecting a Dark Mode theme Drawing with Code Code is written in particular \"languages.\" These languages are not as complicated as \"human\" languages, but each language is slightly different and expects you to write your code is specific ways. size() Reference size() is a function that sets the size of our sketch. The way to call a function, sometimes refereed to as a command, is the function name followed by open and closed parentheses. Functions are very similar to how you might have learned them in your math classes, such as f(x). A function takes in a value, x, and often times, returns a value, f(x). It is important to note that not all functions take in values, but we will take about that a bit later. size() , for example, takes in the parameters width and height . The reference for size() would look something like this: Syntax: size(a, b) Parameters a - width b - height Syntax is the word we use to describe the particular writing style of a programming language. Every programming language has a different syntax . The syntax for size is that it takes in and a and b parameter. a is equal to the width of our sketch and b is equal to our height. If we want our sketch to look be 800 pixels by 800 pixels we could write; //Set our sketch to 800 by 800 pixels size(800,800); Notice the \"//\" on the first line. This marks a comment. A comment is meant for human programmers and is not \"read\" by our computer. Also notice the semi colon \";\" at the end of the second line. For our purposes now, we can think of the semi colon as a period, marking the end of our line of code. Errors If I forget to add a semicolon, my sketch won't run, and Processing will let me know I have an error. //Set our sketch to 800 by 800 pixels size(800,800) background() Reference background() is a function that sets the background for our sketch. background() can take in many different types of parameters including color values and images. For now we'll focus on setting a gray scale value. Syntax: background(a) Parameters a - Gray value (0-255) To draw a middle gray background on our sketch: //Draw a middle gray background background(127); circle() Reference circle() is a function that draws an circle to our screen. Syntax: circle(a, b, c) Parameters a - x-coordinate of the circle b - y-coordinate of the circle c - width and height Coordinate system of Processing Our current sketch with grid lines every 20 pixels To draw a circle with a diameter of 200 in the center our screen we would write: circle(400,400,200); Our circle Our circle on a coordinate grid Drawing Order The order that we write our code is important! The computer \"reads\" our code from the top to bottom, just like we do. The drawing order in Processing is the same. Each shape is drawn on top of the previous shape. Try adding a line of code to make a new circle in the center our our sketch with a diameter of 400 pixels. circle(400,400,400); Because our code now looks like this: //Set our sketch to 800 by 800 pixels size(800,800); //Draw a middle gray background background(127); circle(400,400,200); circle(400,400,400); We are first drawing our background, then drawing our smaller circle, and, finally, the larger circle on top. Our larger circle covering our smaller circle If we change the ordering of our circles: circle(400,400,400); circle(400,400,200); We'll see the smaller circle drawn on top of the larger one: rect() and square() Reference rect() draws a rectangle to our screen. Syntax: rect(a, b, c, d) Parameters a - x-coordinate b - y-coordinate c - width d - height For drawing a rectangle with equal sides, we can also use the square() function. Although for most of this course you might find it helpful to change the sides of your rectangle independently of one another. Syntax: square(a, b, c) Parameters a - x-coordinate b - y-coordinate c - width and height Try drawing a square at (400,400) with a size and width of 200. rect(400,400,200,200); What do you notice? Unlike circle() which places the circle's center at the given (x,y) parameter, rect() places the rectangle at its top left corner. We can think of this as similar to how you might draw out a rectangle on the desktop of your computer. rectMode() Reference We can modify how rectangles are drawn by using the function rectMode() . rectMode() can take in a few parameters, but we will focus on CENTER and CORNER rectMode(CORNER) is the default behavior with our rectangle being draw from the upper left corner. rectMode(CENTER) will draw our rectangle at the center of the given (x,y) coordinates. If we were to write: rect(400,400,200,200); rectMode(CENTER); We would notice that nothing happens. For rectMode() to work properly, we need to tell our computer to draw our rectangles in the center before drawing our rectangle. If we write: rectMode(CENTER); rect(400,400,200,200); We get this result: In essence, rectMode() will effect any rectangle after it is called. With this in mind, we can call rectMode() multiple times in a sketch to change the behavior of different rectangles. Let's try writing: rectMode(CENTER); rect(400,400,200,200); rectMode(CORNER); rect(400,400,200,200); We can see out first rectangle remain in the center, while our second is drawn from the corner. fill() Reference fill() is similar to rectMode() in that it changes the behavior of our shapes. fill() sets the color that shapes are filled with. Before moving onto color, fill() can also take in a gray value between 0 - 255. Syntax: fill(a) Parameters a - Gray value (0-255) Writing fill() before our most recent rectangle: rectMode(CORNER); fill(127); rect(400,400,200,200); It changes the color of our rectangle to gray. Saving Let's save and name our sketch. We can press Ctrl + Shift + S or navigate to File -> Save As Your Processing sketch will save as a folder. Inside that folder will be your sketch, save as a .pde file. To save our file as we continue sketching, we can press Ctrl+S . Drawing Exercise Navigate to File -> New For this exercise, create the below 800 by 800 pixel drawing using the code we have learned so far. Additionally, to get comfortable looking at Processing's reference, to complete this exercise, you'll need to look into the following functions and figure out how to use them in your sketch. line() (Reference) - Draws lines to screen stroke() (Reference) - Sets line and border color noStroke() (Reference) - Turns off strokes strokeWeight() (Reference) - Changes the thickness of strokes Be sure to comment your code to keep track of what you are writing! Begin with: size(800,800); background(200); Color Color Reference Josef & Anni Albers Foundation Anni Albers. Black White Yellow. 1926. Josef Albers. Homage to the Square: \"Ascending\". 1953. Recreation of Josef Albers' painting in Processing Code: //Home to the Square: \"Ascending\" size(800, 800); background(247, 238, 220); //Attributes noStroke(); rectMode(CENTER); //Squares fill(138, 200, 237); rect(400, 400, 780, 780); fill(196, 195, 194); rect(400, 440, 630, 630); fill(255, 250, 244); rect(400, 478, 470, 470); fill(254, 226, 21); rect(400, 517, 313, 313); If we copy this sketch into processing, we notice our fill() looks quite different. Before we would write fill(127); and see our shapes turn gray. Now we can see the syntax is fill(a, b, c) . Processing by default represents colors in Red, Blue and Green values, or RGB for short. Syntax: fill(a,b,c) a - amount of red (0-255); b - amount of green (0-255); c - amount of blue (0-255); This is also true for our background() Syntax: background(a,b,c) a - amount of red (0-255); b - amount of green (0-255); c - amount of blue (0-255); Try changing some of the colors in the Albers' sketch to see the effects. With RGB, we \"mix\" red, green, and blue together to get different results. For example if we wanted to fill our shapes will yellow, we would write: //Yellow in RGB fill(255,255,0); A yellow circle Mixing RGB values leads to a variety of colors: //purple fill(255,0,255); //cyan fill(0,255,255); //white fill(255,255,255); //black fill(0,0,0); Color Selector We can also see the RGB values of colors using Processing's built in color picker. Navigate to Tools -> Color Selector Color Exercise Using the the Color Selector tool for reference, create and 800 x 800 image of three or more shapes that, next to each other, form a gradient. Choose a background color that compliments your gradient. Example: Three circles forming a color gradient Opacity Josef Albers' opacity illusion painting Recreation of Josef Albers' painting using opacity Code: background(134, 119, 90); noStroke(); rectMode(CENTER); fill(97, 88, 89); //Three rectangles behind rect(337.5, 500, 520, 170); rect(337.5, 750, 520, 170); rect(337.5, 250, 520, 170); //Main Center rectangle fill(254, 255, 223); rect(337.5, 500, 350, 850); //Center Rectangles with Opacity fill(97, 88, 89, 230); rect(337.5, 750, 350, 170); fill(97, 88, 89, 180); rect(337.5, 500, 350, 170); fill(97, 88, 89, 100); rect(337.5, 250, 350, 170); With our colors for our fill() , there is a hidden fourth parameter, alpha , commonly known as opacity! Syntax: fill(a, b, c, d) a - amount of red (whole number 0-255) b - amount of green (whole number 0-255) c - amount of blue (whole number 0-255) d - alpha (decimal number 0-255) We'll talk about this more next class, but for now note the while alpha can be a decimal number(e.g. 1.67, 3.14, 88.666), our RGB values can only be entered in as whole number (e.g. 0, 45, 73). In programming, a whole numbers is called an integer or int , for short. A decimal number is called floating-point number , or float for short. We will go into more detail on this next class. Circle at full opacity Circle at half opacity Circle at a quarter opacity Notice how the background color blends with my shape's fill color Opacity Exercise Try creating an image similar to the one you created for the Color Exercise. Instead of using multiple colors, use one color and change the alpha parameter of the fill() function. Independent Exercise: Drawing in Color Due next at the start of next class session. Part 1: Turrell At either sunrise or sunset between now and our next class session attend the lighting program at James Turrell's Dividing the Light at Pomona College Skyspace . James Turell. Dividing the Light. 2007. Reflect on your experience between the relationship between the LED color lights, and the color of the sky. This work is a form of new media art! The lights that are part of exhibition had to be programmed to match with the time of day and to change colors as the sky changes. Exercise: Write a poetic set of instructions for James Turrell's Dividing the Light . How would you describe the colors? What is the progression of the piece? Be as specific as possible.

To do that we need to make a code block. In short, a code block is a section of code that is grouped together. Example: void setup(){ //some code //some more code //even more code } This code block above consists of a few elements: void - This is a return type - we'll touch on this later in the course. Until then, we will be using this keyword void . setup() - This is the name of our function. setup() is a special function that Processing already knows how to handle. { } - Open and closed curly brackets, these indicate where we will write our code. Body - this is just the code that we will be writing. Both setup() and draw() in our Processing sketch would look like this: void setup(){ } void draw(){ } NOTE : Unlike when we were drawing without setup() and draw() , the order of these functions doesn't matter. We could reverse their positions and setup() would still run first. However , the order inside our code blocks does matter. Code will be executed from the top line to the bottom. Drawing with Variables Let's start by going over all we did last class by using the following to draw a circle: size() background() noStroke() fill() circle() size(800,400); background(12,123,220); noStroke(); fill(255,194,10); circle(400,200,80); Result of the above Processing code Now let's put everything in either the setup() or draw() functions. For now, we'll put our size() in setup() and everything else in draw() . void setup(){ size(800,400); } void draw(){ background(12,123,220); noStroke(); fill(255,194,10); circle(400,200,80); } Result of the above Processing code We added a bunch more code, but everything looks the same! Looking more closely at draw() , we can see that even though draw is happening over and over again, its drawing the same thing! In order to make our sketch draw dynamically, we need to change the values of our sketch dynamically. We can do this with variables mouseX and mouseY To start we'll use some of Processing's built-in variables. Reference mouseX is a variable that always stores our mouse's horizontal position. mouseY is a variable that always stores our mouse's vertical position. These values update as we move our mouse! As an experiment, let's replace our circle() x value with mouseX circle(mouseX,200,80); Our circle now follows the horizontal position of our mouse If we change the y value to mouseY : circle(mouseX,mouseY,80); Our circle now follows wherever our mouse goes Let's see what happens if we move our background() to the top of our setup() . Remember, this will cause background() to only run once. void setup(){ size(800,400); background(12,123,220); } void draw(){ noStroke(); fill(255,194,10); circle(mouseX,mouseY,80); } We made a painting program! mousePressed() mousePressed() is a special function within Processing that is called every time we click our mouse. We can use this to clear our drawing to start on a fresh background. To use mousePressed() we need to make a new block of code. To clear our background when our mouse is pressed, we can add a new background() in our mousePressed() function. void setup(){ size(800,400); background(12,123,220); } void draw(){ noStroke(); fill(255,194,10); circle(mouseX,mouseY,80); } void mousePressed(){ background(12,123,220); } We made another painting program! As a note, mouseX and mouseY can replace any value in our sketch. If I move my background() from setup() to draw() and replace my circle diameter with mouseX . circle(400, 200, mouseX); Our mouseX variable now changes the size of our circle! Changing the size of our circle with a variable In-class Exercise: Painting Program Spend some time using the sketch we wrote to create your own painting program! Try adjusting the opacity value in your fill() to get new results! As a bonus, see if you can save your drawing every time you click your mouse using save() . width and height Some other built in Processing variables include width and height . These variables always store the width and height of my sketch. void setup(){ size(800,400); } void draw(){ background(12,123,220); noStroke(); fill(255,194,10); circle(width/2,height/2,80); } Arithmetic Operators + - Addition - - Subtraction * - Multiplication / - Division = - Equals What is a Variable? What is mouseX or width ? Variables are named storage location in our computer's memory where we can store values. mouseX and width are both named storage location where Processing is constantly updating their associated values. Simplified drawing of variables in memory Making our Own Variable Let's work towards this example Steps of a Variable Type of variable Name of variable Initialize variable Types System Variables int - whole numbers float - decimal numbers ...and many more Processing Variables color - type for holding a color value ...and many more Ones we'll use later on String - words and sentences ...and many more Name We can name our variable anything, but it is good to use a name that allows us to keep track of what we want it to do. As an example, circleX to control the x position of our circle. Some rules to follow: Lower case letter to start Dog vs. dog No numbers as first character 1dog vs. dog1 No spaces black cat vs. blackCat use camelCase blackcat vs. blackCat Don\u2019t use reserved keywords or existing Processing variable names int vs. numberOfCats Initialize Give our variable an initial value to start with. We can do this within a block of code: float circleX; void setup(){ size(800,400); circleX = 40; } Or, when we declare our variable: float circleX = 40; void setup(){ size(800,400); } Variable Scope Variables have two levels of scope, global and local . We won't go into too much detail about this now, but in short: Global variables are declared at the top of our sketch. They can be used within any block of code. Local variables are declared within a function and can only be used within that function. Making our Circle Move After we declare the type and name of our variable and initialize its value, we should have this sketch: float circleX = 0; void setup(){ size(800,400); } void draw(){ background(12,123,220); noStroke(); fill(255,194,10); circle(400,200,80); } Then we need to replace our circle's X value with our new variable: circle(x,200,80); Lastly, we need a way to increase our variable over time. For this, we can use an incrementation operator. Incrementation Operators We need to increase our variable by a certain value, then assign that new value back to our variable. ourVariable = ourVariable+1 = ourVariable+=1 = ourVariable++ Subtraction - ourVariable-=2 Multiplication - ourVariable*=2 Division - ourVariable/=2 To move our circle, we can increment our variable circleX by 1 each time draw() is called. float circleX = 0; void setup(){ size(800, 400); } void draw(){ background(12, 123, 220); noStroke(); fill(255, 194, 10); circle(circleX, 200, 80); circleX += 1; } Our moving circle! We can change how fast the circle is moving by changing the value circleX is changing by. circleX += 20; random() Reference Syntax: random(high) returns a random value between 0 and high random(low,high) returns a random value between low and high Parameters low - (float) lower limit high - (float) upper limit This is the first function we\u2019ll be using that returns a value! Using Random We can use random() to give circleX a random value. float circleX = random(0,width); We can use random() to give our circle a random size each time we press the mouse! float circleSize = 0; void setup(){ size(800, 400); } void draw(){ background(12, 123, 220); noStroke(); fill(255, 194, 10); circle(width/2, height/2, circleSize); } void mousePressed(){ circleSize = random(0,width); } Or, by moving our background() and adding in some more variables, we can make many circles appear randomly on our screen. Variables: x y a r b g float y; float x; float a; float r; float g; float b; void setup(){ size(800, 400); background(12, 123, 220); } void draw(){ noStroke(); y = random(height); x = random(width); a = random(60,200); r = random(200,255); g = random(200,255); b = random(100); fill(r, g, b,a); circle(x, y,30); } Independent Exercise: Face Generator DUE: By beginning of next class Make a new Processing sketch and copy the example code below. Read this code and play around with it to figure out how it works - a large part of learning to program is by reading the code of others! float faceSize; float eyeSize; float eyeX; float eyeY; float mouthY; float mouthSizeX; float mouthSizeY; void setup() { size(800, 800); } void draw() { //face fill(147, 41, 214); circle(width/2, height/2, faceSize); //eyes fill(255); circle(width/2+eyeX, height/2-eyeY, eyeSize); circle(width/2-eyeX, height/2-eyeY, eyeSize); //pupils fill(0); circle(width/2+eyeX, height/2-eyeY, eyeSize*.5); circle(width/2-eyeX, height/2-eyeY, eyeSize*.5); //mouth fill(255, 0, 0); rectMode(CENTER); rect(width/2, height/2+mouthY, mouthSizeX, mouthSizeY); } void mousePressed() { noStroke(); background(random(100, 255), random(100, 255), random(60)); //face faceSize = random(300, width*.75); //eyes eyeSize = faceSize * random(.1, .7); eyeX = random(faceSize/10, faceSize/2); eyeY = random(faceSize/10, faceSize/5); //mouth mouthY = random(faceSize/10, faceSize/2); mouthSizeX = faceSize*random(.1, .8); mouthSizeY = mouthSizeX*random(.1, .2); } Use this code to make your own custom face generator! Maybe you add a nose, or hair! Or maybe you start from scratch and try to make your own custom generator. This is only an exercise, so play around and see what you can come up with! The only requirement of this exercise is that you add one more shape that has its size, position, or color, controlled by variables. See if you can see the relationships between the different shapes to add your own features. Submit In the class Discord, share 3 (or more) of your favorite faces your generator made.

To do that we need to make a code block. In short, a code block is a section of code that is grouped together. Example: void setup(){ //some code //some more code //even more code } This code block above consists of a few elements: void - This is a return type - we'll touch on this later in the course. Until then, we will be using this keyword void . setup() - This is the name of our function. setup() is a special function that Processing already knows how to handle. { } - Open and closed curly brackets, these indicate where we will write our code. Body - this is just the code that we will be writing. Both setup() and draw() in our Processing sketch would look like this: void setup(){ } void draw(){ } NOTE : Unlike when we were drawing without setup() and draw() , the order of these functions doesn't matter. We could reverse their positions and setup() would still run first. However , the order inside our code blocks does matter.
